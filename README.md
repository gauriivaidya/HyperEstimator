# HyperEstimator

## Introduction
HyperEstimator is an approach using [Grammatical Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_evolution) (GE), a grammar based evolutionary algorithm, Linear Regression and Bayesian Optimisation to tune the hyperparameters for a Convolutional Neural Networks, using a sample of 5% of the dataset. 

HyperEstimator is implemented using [PonyGE2](https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2), and using python libraries. For more details on PonyGE2, please visis.

The approach HyperEstimator is published in [ICSBT 2022](https://icsbt.scitevents.org/), and available [online](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362055158_HyperEstimator_Evolving_Computationally_Efficient_CNN_Models_with_Grammatical_Evolution). The steps to implement HyperEstimator or recreating methods and results for the paper can be referred from [Wiki](https://github.com/gauriivaidya/HyperEstimator/wiki).
